At the first sight of rays of light I hear the birds sing
It's a sign he's given me every thing will be OK
Sometimes when I wake up
And I'm wondering
How my life would have been if I didn't sing
I get a little stressed out every now and then
But problems come and problems go when I'm around him
Blessed in the morning
Blessed in the evening
And again I realize the reason why I sing

At the first sight of rays of light I hear the birds sing

But problems come and problems go when I'm around him
Blessed in the morning

And again I realize the reason why I sing

Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed
I need ya
Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed
Oh yeah
Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed

Every time
Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed
I'm blessed
Always
I'm blessed
I'm blessed
I'm blessed
So blessed
I'm blessed
So blessed
